  # PWA Text Editor
  
  ## Description
  This project is a browser-based text editor implemented as a Progressive Web App (PWA) with offline capabilities. It utilizes IndexedDB for seamless data storage and retrieval, facilitated by the idb package, ensuring robustness across browsers. With redundancy in data persistence techniques, the app guarantees reliable functionality even in environments with limited internet connectivity.
